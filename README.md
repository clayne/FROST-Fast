# Preamble

![FROST Fast Cover](https://github.com/interworlder/FROST-Fast/blob/main/Cover.jpg)

FROST is a total conversion mod which turns Fallout 4 into a challenging survival experience. It has brand new lore, enemies, and gameplay systems.

This modlist, **FROST Fast**, collects multiple mods for you to install with Wabbajack. It's good for anyone who wants to enjoy a modern FROST experience in a relatively fast and easy way--and without being required to learn everything about modding.

Many talented mod authors have contributed to the current state of FROST: which is remarkably bug-free and still being expanded! All credit goes to those authors.

# Installation

These steps will guide you through installing **FROST Fast** for the first time.

If you want to update an existing version of **FROST Fast**, then please jump straight to [Updating](#updating).

## Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

This package is required for Mod Organizer 2. It is likely that you already have this package installed, but if not, go ahead and install it now.

You can download this package directly from [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads). Select the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". [Here is the direct download link.](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

## Steam Config

Right click on _Fallout 4_ in your Steam library and select _Properties_.

### Disable the Steam Overlay

In the _General_ tab, un-tick the checkbox for _Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game_.

(The Steam Overlay can cause issues with ENB, so it is recommended to be turned off. While this modlist does not contain ENB, this setting will help if you choose to add it later.)

### Disable the Steam Cloud

In the same _General_ tab, un-tick the checkbox for _Keep game saves in the Steam Cloud for Fallout 4_.

(Save files generated by the modded game are not compatible with the base game.)

### Change Steam's update behavior

Go to the _Updates_ tab. Under _Automatic Updates_, select the option _Only update this game when I launch it_.

(Updates to Fallout 4 can break existing mods, so we want to make sure Steam does not automatically or unexpectedly update the game.)

### Set the game language to English

Go to the _Language_ tab. Make sure that _English_ is selected.

(This modlist only supports the English language.)

## Clean Fallout 4

If you have modded Fallout 4 in the past, then you must clean your game folder to prevent conflicts. Do not skip this step!

If you have NOT modded Fallout 4 in the past, then you can skip to the [Start Fallout 4](#start-fallout-4) section.

1. Uninstall the game through Steam
2. Delete the game folder, which should be C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4 by default
3. Delete the game's save/config folder, which should be C:\Users\yourname\Documents\My Games\Fallout4 by default
4. Reinstall the game through Steam

## Start Fallout 4

You should have a clean installation at this point. Run Fallout 4.

1. Start the game through Steam
2. Click on _Options_ in the game launcher window
3. Set the _Aspect Ratio_ and _Resolution_ to your monitor's native values
4. Set the other graphics settings according to your preferences and hardware
5. Click _OK_ when you are done
6. Click _Play_
7. Wait for the game to load, and then exit when you see the main menu

## Using Wabbajack

### Download Wabbajack

Download the latest release of Wabbajack from [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases).

Place the _Wabbajack.exe_ file in a new folder, e.g. C:\Wabbajack.

### Download the modlist

Download the latest release of **FROST Fast** from [Github](https://github.com/interworlder/FROST-Fast/releases). For your convenience, [here is the direct download link](https://github.com/interworlder/FROST-Fast/releases/download/v1.5.1/FROST.Fast.wabbajack). You can save it in the same folder as Wabbajack, e.g. C:\Wabbajack.

### Install the modlist

Keep in mind that downloading and installing the full modlist can take a very long time (depending on your system specs and connection speed).

1. Run Wabbajack.exe
2. Click on _Install From Disk_ and open the file _FROST Fast.wabbajack_
3. Set the _Installation Location_, e.g. C:\FROST-Fast\Install
4. Set the _Download Location_, e.g. C:\FROST-Fast\Download
5. Click the Start button
6. Follow any instructions from Wabbajack (sign into NexusMods, click the download buttons, etc.)
7. Wait for Wabbajack to finish -- this can take a very long time!

### Errors in Wabbajack

If you run into any errors, your first move should be exiting Wabbajack and following the above steps to "Install the modlist" again.

Wabbajack will safely re-check its own installation, pick up where it left off, and re-try any failed downloads.

#### Wabbajack could not find my game folder

Sorry! Wabbajack will not work with pirated versions of the game. If you own a legitimate copy of the game, start over from the beginning of [Installation](#installation) and don't skip any steps.

## Post-Installation

### Copy Game Folder Files

Copy all of the files from "Game Folder Files" in the install location, e.g. C:\FROST-Fast\Install\MO2\Game Folder Files

Paste the files directly into your game folder. In Windows, your game folder defaults to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4

### Edit INI files

Go to your game's save/config folder, which should be C:\Users\yourname\Documents\My Games\Fallout4 by default.

Open Fallout4Prefs.ini and add these lines under \[Display\]:

```
uPipboyTargetHeight=1400
uPipboyTargetWidth=1752
fPipboyScreenEmitIntensityPA=1.25
fPipboyScreenDiffuseIntensityPA=0.15
```

Add this line under \[Imagespace\]:

```
bLensFlare=0
```

Add this line under \[Pipboy\]:

```
bPipboyDisableFX=1
```

Save your changes to Fallout4Prefs.ini.

Next... Open Fallout4.ini, and add this line under \[General\]:

```
sStartingConsoleCommand=cl off
```

Add this line under \[Archive\]:
```
bInvalidateOlderFiles=1
```

And make sure this entry under \[Archive\] is blank, like so:
```
sResourceDataDirsFinal=
```

Save your changes to Fallout4.ini.

### Starting FROST for the First Time

Go to the install location, e.g. C:\FROST-Fast\Install

Run ModOrganizer.exe.

At the top-right, F4SE should be selected already. Click Run.

From the main menu, go to Settings > Gameplay. _New Game Difficulty_ should be set as _Survival_.

In Settings > Display, personalize your HUD and Pipboy colors if needed.

* HUD Color R
* HUD Color G
* HUD Color B
* Pip-Boy Color R
* Pip-Boy Color G
* Pip-Boy Color B

Return to the main menu.

Click _New_ to start the game!

### MCM Configuration

When you have finished character setup, hit _ESC_ and click _Mod Config_.

NPCs Travel is the only one which *must* be configured.

* NPCs Travel > Number of NPCs > set Synth Patrol to 0
* NPCs Travel > Number of NPCs > DLC > set everything under Far Harbor to 0, including Nuka-World and Nuka-World Open Season

### Holotape Configuration

There are optional settings accessible via Pip-Boy holotapes. You can craft them at any Chemistry Table.

You are done with installation!

## Optional High-Res Textures

These retexture mods are optional, but they can improve the game's visual fidelity greatly. Consider adding them to your modlist under the "Retextures" section! You will need a video card with at least 8GB VRAM.

* [Valius High Resolution Texture Pack 4K](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/318?tab=files)
* [Natural Landscapes 4K](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/38841?tab=files)

## Updating

## FAQ

**Why do enemies and mines sometimes disappear after loading a save?**

This is a bug from vanilla Fallout 4 which was unfortunately never fixed by Bethesda. You can get past it by quitting the game to desktop, starting the game again, and loading the save. This will ensure that enemies and explosives are respawned correctly.

**Any other known bugs?**

* If the player is wearing power armor, using Scavver's Toolbox can hang the game. As a workaround, exit the power armor first.

**Can I add player textures, 3d model replacers, and other cosmetic mods?**

Yes, you would want to put those mods under the "Player Appearance" separator in Mod Organizer 2. Remember to re-order the plugins (on the right) so they match the mod list (on the left).

**Why is the R88 Simple Sorter mod included in the modlist?**

This ESP is not technically required, but I have included it just in case someone wants to generate their own custom item sorting list using Complex Sorter.

**Can I add NSFW (Not Safe For Work) mods?**

Yes, you can, but unfortunately I cannot provide support in that area!

**Why isn't the PANPC mod included in the modlist?**

The current download license for Pack Attack NPC forbids its inclusion from any modpack or automated modlist. Sorry! Of course, feel free to add the mod yourself (along with its FROST compatibility patch).

## Removing the Modlist

In order to uninstall **FROST Fast** completely, you will need to delete your Installation and Download Locations. If you followed this guide verbatim, then you should delete C:\FROST-Fast entirely.

Next, follow all of the steps in the [Clean Fallout 4](#clean-fallout-4) section again. Done! You should have a clean installation of Fallout 4 again.

(Optional) If you do not want Wabbajack anymore, you will need to delete your Wabbajack folder too. If you followed this guide verbatim, then you should delete C:\Wabbajack.

(Optional) And if you do not want Fallout 4 anymore, then you should remove Fallout 4 through Steam.
