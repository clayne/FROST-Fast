# Preamble

![FROST Fast Cover](FROST Fast Cover.jpg)

**FROST Fast** is a Wabbajack modlist for Fallout 4.

The modlist revolves around [FROST](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/18898), a total conversion mod which replaces vanilla quests and NPCs to create a more freeform survival experience. There is new lore, new enemies, and new gameplay systems. Your only goal in FROST is to survive... good luck!

This modlist incorporates many fixes, quality-of-life mods, and a few immersion-related changes.

# Installation

These steps will guide you through installing **FROST Fast** for the first time.

If you need to update an existing version of **FROST Fast**, then please jump straight to [Updating](#updating).

## Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

This package is required for Mod Organizer 2. It is likely that you already have this package installed, but if not, go ahead and install it now.

You can download this package directly from [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads). Select the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". [Here is the direct download link.](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

## Steam Config

Right click on _Fallout 4_ in your Steam library and select _Properties_.

### Disable the Steam Overlay

In the _General_ tab, un-tick the checkbox for _Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game_.

The Steam Overlay can cause issues with ENB, so it is recommended to be turned off. While this modlist does not contain ENB, you might want to add your own choice of ENB later.

### Disable the Steam Cloud

In the _General_ tab, un-tick the checkbox for _Keep game saves in the Steam Cloud for Fallout 4_.

Save files generated by your modded game are not compatible with the base game.

### Change Steam's update behavior

Go to the _Updates_ tab. Under _Automatic Updates_, select the option _Only update this game when I launch it_.

Updates to Fallout 4 can break existing mods, so we want to make sure Steam does not automatically update the game.

### Set the game language to English

Go to the _Language_ tab. Make sure that _English_ is selected.

This modlist only supports the English language.

## Clean Fallout 4

If you have modded Fallout 4 in the past, then you must clean your game folder to prevent conflicts.

1. Uninstall the game through Steam
2. Delete the game folder, which should be C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4 by default
3. Delete the game's save/config folder, which should be C:\Users\yourname\Documents\My Games\Fallout4 by default
4. Reinstall the game through Steam

## Start Fallout 4

You should now have a clean installation, so you can proceed with a first-time run.

1. Start the game through Steam
2. Click on _Options_ in the game launcher window
3. Set the _Aspect Ratio_ and _Resolution_ to your monitor's native values
4. Set the other graphics settings according to your preferences and hardware
5. Click _OK_ when you are done
6. Click _Play_
7. Wait for the game to load, and exit when you see the main menu

## Using Wabbajack

### Download Wabbajack

Download the latest release of Wabbajack from [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases).

Place the _Wabbajack.exe_ file in a new folder, e.g. C:\Wabbajack.

### Download the modlist

Download the latest release of **FROST Fast** from [Github](https://github.com/interworlder//releases). For your convenience, [here is the direct download link](https://github.com/interworlder/FROST-Fast/releases/download/v0.2.0/FROST.Fast.wabbajack). Feel free to save it in the same directory, e.g. C:\Wabbajack.

### Install the modlist

Keep in mind that downloading and installing the full modlist can take a very long time (depending on your system specs and connection speed).

1. Run Wabbajack.exe
2. Click on _Install From Disk_ and open the file _FROST-Fast.wabbajack_
3. Set the _Installation Location_ as C:\FROST-Fast\Install
4. Set the _Download Location_ as C:\FROST-Fast\Download
5. Click the Go/Start button
6. Follow any instructions from Wabbajack (sign into NexusMods, click the download buttons, etc.)
6. Wait for Wabbajack to finish -- this can take a very long time!

### Errors in Wabbajack

If you see errors, run Wabbajack again by following the above "Install the mods" steps again. Wabbajack will safely continue where it left off, and it will automatically re-try any mod downloads which failed.

#### Wabbajack could not find my game folder

Wabbajack will not work with pirated versions of the game. You must buy the game to use this tool.

## Post-Installation

### Copy Game Folder Files

Copy all of the files from C:\FROST-Fast\Install\MO2\Game Folder Files, and paste them directly into your game folder.

Your game folder should be C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4 by default in Windows.

## Updating

If this modlist has been updated, please read the [Changelog](#changelog) before doing anything else.

Backup your saves, but keep in mind that saves are often incompatible with a new version. Starting a new game is the safest option after updating.

**Note that Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the modlist when updating!**

Ready to update? Updating with Wabbajack is similar to the first-time installation. Select your Installation and Download Locations again, but make sure to tick the checkbox _Overwrite Installation_. Click the Go/Start button, and wait for Wabbajack to finish.
