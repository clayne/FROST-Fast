# Preamble

FROST-Fast is a Wabbajack modlist for Fallout 4.

The modlist revolves around [FROST](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/18898), a total conversion mod which replaces vanilla quests and NPCs to create a more freeform survival experience. There is new lore, new enemies, and new gameplay systems. Your only goal in FROST is to survive. Good luck!

The goal of this modlist is to give new players an easy way to experience the challenging and immersive world of FROST. As such, it incorporates many fixes, quality-of-life mods, and a few immersion-related changes (mostly audio).

## Installation

### Pre-Installation

These steps are needed if you are installing FROST-Fast for the first time. If you are updating an existing install, please jump straight to [Updating](#updating).

#### Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

It is likely that you already have this package installed. But if not, install it now! There is no harm in manually installing this.

This package is required for Mod Organizer 2, and you can download it directly from [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads). Select the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". [Here is the direct link](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

#### Steam Config

Right click on _Fallout 4_ in your Steam library and select _Properties_.

##### Disable the Steam Overlay

In the _General_ tab, un-tick the checkbox for _Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game_.

The Steam Overlay can cause issues with ENB, so it is recommended to be turned off. While this modlist does not contain ENB, you might want to add your own choice of ENB later.

##### Disable the Steam Cloud

Also in the _General_ tab, un-tick the checkbox for _Keep game saves in the Steam Cloud for Fallout 4_.

Save files generated by your modded game are not compatible with the base game.

##### Change Steam's update behavior

Go to the _Updates_ tab. Under _Automatic Updates_, select the option _Only update this game when I launch it_.

Updates to Fallout 4 can break existing mods, so we want to make sure Steam does not automatically update the game.

##### Set the game language to English

Go to the _Language_ tab. Make sure that _English_ is selected.

This modlist only supports the English language.

#### Clean Fallout 4

If you have modded Fallout 4 in the past, then you must clean the game folder to prevent conflicts.

1. Uninstall the game through Steam
2. Delete the game folder, which should be C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4 by default
3. Delete the game's save/config folder, which should be C:\Users\yourname\Documents\My Games\Fallout4 by default
4. Reinstall the game through Steam

#### Start Fallout 4

After completing the above steps, you should now have a clean installation.

1. Start the game through Steam
2. Click on _Options_ in the game launcher window
3. Set the _Aspect Ratio_ and _Resolution_ to your monitor's native values
4. Set the other graphics settings according to your preferences and hardware
5. Click _OK_ when you are done
6. Click _Play_
7. Wait for the game to load, and exit when you see the main menu

### Using Wabbajack

#### Preparation

Download the latest release of Wabbajack from [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases).

Place the _Wabbajack.exe_ file in a new folder, C:\Wabbajack.

#### Download and install

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs and connection speed! Try to be patient.

1. Open Wabbajack
2. Click on _Install From Disk_ and open the file _FROST-Fast.wabbajack_
3. Set the _Installation Location_ as C:\FROST-Fast\Install
4. Set the _Download Location_ as C:\FROST-Fast\Download
5. Click the Go/Start button
6. Follow any instructions from Wabbajack (sign into NexusMods, click the download buttons, etc.)
6. Wait for Wabbajack to finish -- this can take a very long time!

##### Did you run into a problem with Wabbajack?

There are many reasons for Wabbajack to encounter an error. Do not panic! Simply re-run Wabbajack by following the "Download and install" steps again. Wabbajack will safely continue where it left off and try again wherever needed.

**Could not download X**:

If a mod has been updated and the old files were deleted, then it is impossible for Wabbajack to download those files. In this case, wait until the modlist is updated.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder**:

Wabbajack will not work with a pirated version of the game. If you own the game on Steam, go back to the [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation) steps.

### Post-Installation

#### Copy Game Folder Files

Copy all of the files from C:\FROST-Fast\Install\MO2\Game Folder Files, and paste them directly into your game folder.

Your game folder should be C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4 by default in Windows.

## Updating

If this modlist is updated, please read the [Changelog](#changelog) before doing anything else. Always backup your saves or start a new game after updating.

**Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the modlist when updating!**

This means that any additional mods you have installed will be deleted. Your downloads folder will not be touched.

Updating through Wabbajack is similar to installing. Select the Installation Location and Download Location again, but make sure you tick the checkbox _Overwrite Installation_.
